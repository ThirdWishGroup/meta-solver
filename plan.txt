## 2. **Define the Computational Domain and Discretization** <a name="section2"></a>

**Steps**:

1. **Define Physical Properties**:
   - **Nodes**: Manholes, inlets, and junctions.
   - **Conduits**: Pipes connecting the nodes.
   - **Subcatchments**: Areas contributing runoff.

2. **Spatial Discretization**:
   - **Determine \( \Delta x \)**:
     - **Approach**: Base \( \Delta x \) on the smallest physical feature of the network, such as the minimum pipe diameter or the steepest slope.
     - **Example**: Choose \( \Delta x \) to ensure at least 10 grid points across critical transitions or hydraulic jumps.
   - **Divide the conduits** into discrete segments (cells) of length \( \Delta x \).
   - **Index the spatial points** as \( i = 0, 1, 2, ..., N \).

3. **Temporal Discretization**:
   - **Determine \( \Delta t \)**:
     - **Approach**: Base \( \Delta t \) on the fastest flow speed and the chosen \( \Delta x \) to ensure numerical accuracy.
     - **Example**: \( \Delta t = \frac{\Delta x}{C_p} \), where \( C_p \) is the speed of the pressure wave.
   - **Choose \( \Delta t \)** to balance computational load and accuracy.
   - **Index the time steps** as \( n = 0, 1, 2, ..., T \).

4. **Data Structures**:
   - Use **NumPy arrays** to store variables like \( A \), \( Q \), \( h \), \( B \) at each spatial and temporal point.
   - **Preallocate arrays** to enhance performance and manage memory efficiently.

**Grid Convergence Verification**:
- **Approach**: Perform simulations with progressively finer \( \Delta x \) and \( \Delta t \) to ensure that results converge within the defined accuracy tolerance.
- **Implementation**: Compare key output metrics (e.g., peak flow rates, water depths) across different grid resolutions.

---

## 3. **Set Up Initial and Boundary Conditions** <a name="section3"></a>

**Initial Conditions**:

- **Flow Rate (\( Q \))**:
  - Initialize all conduits with a starting flow rate, typically \( Q = 0 \) m³/s or a steady-state flow value.
  
- **Cross-Sectional Area (\( A \)) or Depth (\( h \))**:
  - Initialize water depths across all nodes and conduit segments, ensuring non-negative and physically plausible values.

**Boundary Conditions**:

- **Upstream Boundary**:
  - **Inflow Hydrograph**:
    - Handle dynamic inflow by defining inflow rates that can change over time.
    - **Implementation**: Use **smoothing functions** (e.g., moving averages) to limit rapid changes and prevent boundary oscillations.
  
- **Downstream Boundary**:
  - **Water Level**:
    - Set a fixed water level or define a **rating curve** that relates \( Q \) and \( h \).
    - Implement **non-reflective boundary conditions** to minimize artificial reflections of waves back into the system.
  
**Handling Dynamic Boundaries**:

- **Rapidly Changing Inflows**:
  - Implement **smoothing techniques** to prevent sudden jumps in inflow rates.
  - Limit the rate of change in inflow using **rate-of-change constraints**.
  
- **Non-Reflective Outflows**:
  - Use **radiation boundary conditions** or **characteristic-based methods** to absorb outgoing waves and prevent reflections.

**Implementation**:

## 4. **Implement the Numerical Scheme** <a name="section4"></a>

**Preissmann Scheme Implementation**:

1. **Function Approximation**:
   \[
   f = \frac{\theta}{2} \left( f^{n+1}_{i+1} + f^{n+1}_i \right) + \frac{1 - \theta}{2} \left( f^n_{i+1} + f^n_i \right)
   \]

2. **Spatial Derivative Approximation**:
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\theta}{\Delta x} \left( f^{n+1}_{i+1} - f^{n+1}_i \right) + \frac{1 - \theta}{\Delta x} \left( f^n_{i+1} - f^n_i \right)
   \]

3. **Temporal Derivative Approximation**:
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{2 \Delta t} \left( f^{n+1}_i + f^{n+1}_{i+1} - f^n_i - f^n_{i+1} \right)
   \]

**Implementation Steps**:

- **Choose Weighting Factor \( \theta \)**:
  - Set \( \theta \) between 0.5 (central differencing) and 1 (fully implicit).
  - **Recommendation**: \( \theta = 0.6 \) to \( 0.7 \) for a balance between stability and accuracy.

- **Discretize Equations**:
  - Apply the Preissmann scheme approximations to both the continuity and momentum equations.
  - Ensure discretization captures critical flow features without excessive numerical diffusion.

- **Matrix Formulation**:
  - Assemble the discretized equations into a matrix equation \( \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \), where \( \mathbf{x} \) contains the unknowns \( Q^{n+1} \) and \( A^{n+1} \).
  
**Addressing Numerical Diffusion**:

- **Post-Solution Verification**:
  - After solving, check for the presence of hydraulic jumps or steep transitions.
  - Compare against expected sharp features to ensure minimal artificial damping.
  - Adjust \( \theta \), \( \Delta x \), or \( \Delta t \) if excessive smoothing is detected.

## 5. **Handle Transition Between Free-Surface and Pressurized Flow** <a name="section5"></a>

**Preissmann Slot Method**:

1. **Concept**:
   - Introduce a narrow vertical slot at the top of the conduit to allow for smooth transitions between free-surface and pressurized flows.

2. **Calculate Free Surface Width (\( B \))**:
   \[
   B = \frac{g A_f}{C_p^2}
   \]
   - **\( A_f \)**: Full cross-sectional area of the pipe.
   - **\( C_p \)**: Speed of the pressure wave, determined by pipe material and properties.

3. **Transition Criteria**:
   - **Switch Condition**: Transition from free-surface to pressurized flow occurs when the water depth \( h \) exceeds the pipe's physical height \( h_{pipe} \).
   - **Implementation**:
     - Monitor \( h \) at each time step and spatial point.
     - If \( h \geq h_{pipe} \), activate pressurized flow equations; otherwise, use free-surface flow equations.

**Implementation Steps**:

- **Create a Function to Compute \( B \)**:
  - Calculate \( B \) based on \( A_f \) and \( C_p \) for each conduit.
  
- **Adjust Continuity and Momentum Equations**:
  - Incorporate \( B \) into the discretized equations to account for the presence of the Preissmann slot.
  
- **Ensure Physical Justification**:
  - Only apply pressurized flow equations when \( h \) physically justifies it.
  - Prevent artificial pressurization by strictly adhering to the switch condition.

---

## 6. **Assemble and Solve the System of Equations** <a name="section6"></a>

**Steps**:

1. **Assemble Equations**:
   - For each spatial point \( i \) and time step \( n+1 \), write the discretized continuity and momentum equations.
   - Include contributions from neighboring points \( i-1 \) and \( i+1 \).
   
2. **Matrix Assembly**:
   - Collect all equations into a global system matrix \( \mathbf{A} \).
   - The unknown vector \( \mathbf{x} \) contains \( Q^{n+1} \) and \( A^{n+1} \) for all spatial points.
   - Utilize **sparse matrix representations** (e.g., CSR format) to enhance computational efficiency.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - Modify the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) and vector \( \mathbf{b} \) to include boundary conditions.
   - Implement boundary conditions directly into the matrix system to maintain consistency.

4. **Solving the Linear System**:
   - Use numerical solvers suitable for sparse matrices, such as SciPy's `sparse.linalg` module.
   - Preferred methods:
     - **LU Decomposition**: For direct solutions in smaller systems.
     - **GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual)**: For larger, more complex systems.

5. **Handling Singular or Ill-Conditioned Systems**:
   - **Error Checking**:
     - Monitor the condition number of \( \mathbf{A} \) to detect ill-conditioning.
     - Implement try-except blocks to catch solver errors.
   
   - **Fallback Strategies**:
     - If \( \mathbf{A} \) is ill-conditioned, slightly increase \( \Delta t \) to stabilize the system.
     - Reassemble the matrix with adjusted parameters to avoid singularities.

---

## 7. **Implement Time-Stepping Loop** <a name="section7"></a>

**Algorithm**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set \( n = 0 \).
   - Initialize \( Q^0 \) and \( A^0 \) based on initial conditions.

2. **Time-Stepping Loop**:
   
   ```python
   for n in range(0, T):
       # Assemble and solve the system of equations for time step n+1
       assemble_system(n, Q, A)
       try:
           solve_system()
       except SolverError:
           # Handle solver failure (e.g., increase Δt, log error)
           adjust_time_step()
           continue
       
       # Update variables for the next time step
       Q[n+1] = computed_Q
       A[n+1] = computed_A
       
       # Apply boundary conditions
       apply_boundary_conditions(n+1, Q, A)
       
       # Monitor key variables for stability
       if check_for_instability(Q, A):
           log_warning(n)
           # Optionally, take corrective action
   ```

3. **Safeguard Mechanism**:
   - **Monitoring**:
     - Track changes in key variables (e.g., \( Q \), \( h \)) between consecutive time steps.
     - Define thresholds for acceptable changes to detect potential instabilities.
   
   - **Response to Instabilities**:
     - If changes exceed thresholds, log warnings and flag the step for review.
     - Optionally, implement corrective actions such as reducing \( \Delta t \) for the next step.

4. **Updating Variables**:
   - After solving, update all flow variables.
   - Store the results for post-processing and visualization.

## 8. **Ensure Numerical Stability and Precision** <a name="section8"></a>

**Stability Considerations**:

- **Weighting Factor \( \theta \)**:
  - Choose \( \theta \) close to 1 (e.g., \( \theta = 0.6 \) to \( 0.7 \)) to enhance stability via implicit schemes.
  
- **Time Step \( \Delta t \)**:
  - Although not restricted by the CFL condition, select \( \Delta t \) to balance computational efficiency and accuracy.
  - Avoid excessively large \( \Delta t \) that can degrade solution accuracy.
  
- **Convergence Criteria**:
  - Set specific tolerances for iterative solvers, e.g., \( 10^{-6} \).
  - Implement checks to ensure solutions meet these criteria at each time step.

**Precision**:

- **Floating-Point Representation**:
  - Use **double-precision** floating-point numbers (`float64` in NumPy) to minimize numerical errors.
  
- **Non-Physical Values Monitoring**:
  - Regularly check for non-physical values such as negative depths or excessively high flow rates.
  - Implement **validation checks** post-solution to identify and rectify such anomalies.

**Convergence Handling**:

- **Define Tolerances**:
  - Explicitly set convergence tolerances for solvers (e.g., residuals below \( 10^{-6} \)).
  
- **Diagnostics**:
  - Provide diagnostic outputs to monitor convergence status at each time step.
  - Log instances where convergence criteria are not met for further investigation.

   - Incorporate these equations into the global system matrix \( \mathbf{A} \).

3. **Handling Dynamic Networks**:
   - For networks with multiple branches, pumps, or overflows, ensure that all additional flow components are accounted for in the continuity equations.
   - **Mass Balance Checks**:
     - After each simulation, perform a **mass balance check** to verify that no mass is artificially lost or created at the nodes.
     - Calculate the total inflow and outflow and ensure they match within the defined tolerance.

**Boundary Conditions**:

- **Known Inflows/Outflows**:
  - Directly set \( Q \) or \( h \) at boundary nodes based on predefined conditions.
  
- **Open Boundaries**:
