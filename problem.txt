A one-dimensional hydraulic model to solve the **Saint-Venant equations** for the drainage network. The system consists of:
- **Nodes**: Representing manholes and inlets.
- **Conduits**: Representing pipes.
- **Subcatchments**: Representing areas that collect runoff.

The Saint-Venant equations are solved iteratively, ensuring high precision and stability, without being restricted by the Courant condition.

### 2. **Core Equations: Saint-Venant for Free-Surface Flow**

The hydraulic system in InfoWorks ICM uses the **Saint-Venant equations** (Yen, 1973), which consist of:

#### A. **Continuity Equation** (Conservation of Mass)
\[
\frac{\partial A}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = 0
\]
Where:
- \( A \): Cross-sectional area (m²)
- \( Q \): Flow rate (m³/s)
- \( x \): Spatial coordinate (m)
- \( t \): Time (s)

This equation ensures that the mass of the fluid is conserved as it moves through the system.

#### B. **Momentum Equation** (Conservation of Momentum)
\[
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{Q^2}{A} \right) + gA \left( \cos\theta \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} - S_0 \right) + \frac{Q |Q|}{K^2} = 0
\]
Where:
- \( g \): Gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²)
- \( h \): Water depth (m)
- \( \theta \): Bed slope angle
- \( S_0 \): Bed slope
- \( K \): Conveyance parameter for frictional losses

This equation accounts for the dynamics of the flow under the influence of pressure forces, gravitational forces, and frictional losses.

### 3. **Transition Between Free-Surface Flow and Pressurized Flow**

The transition from free-surface flow to pressurized flow is handled using the **Preissmann slot method**. This method introduces a narrow vertical slot at the top of the pipe, allowing for smooth transitions when the water level exceeds the height of the pipe.

#### A. **Free Surface Width in Pressurized Flow**
\[
B = \frac{g A_f}{C_p^2}
\]
Where:
- \( B \): Width of the free surface (m)
- \( A_f \): Full cross-sectional area of the pipe (m²)
- \( C_p \): Speed of the pressure wave (m/s)

This equation governs the pressurized flow, where the width of the free surface is conceptually replaced by a small value when the flow becomes pressurized.

### 4. **Numerical Approximation: Preissmann Scheme**

The **Preissmann scheme** is used to approximate the Saint-Venant equations, providing stability and flexibility for solving unsteady flow problems.

#### A. **Function Approximation**
\[
f = \frac{\theta}{2} \left( f^{n+1}_{i+1} + f^{n+1}_i \right) + \frac{1 - \theta}{2} \left( f^n_{i+1} + f^n_i \right)
\]
Where:
- \( \theta \): Weighting factor
- \( f \): Function (e.g., flow rate or cross-sectional area)
- \( n \): Time index
- \( i \): Spatial index

#### B. **Spatial Derivative Approximation**
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\theta}{\Delta x} \left( f^{n+1}_{i+1} - f^{n+1}_i \right) + \frac{1 - \theta}{\Delta x} \left( f^n_{i+1} - f^n_i \right)
\]

#### C. **Temporal Derivative Approximation**
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{2 \Delta t} \left( f^{n+1}_i + f^{n+1}_{i+1} - f^n_i - f^n_{i+1} \right)
\]

This method is used to approximate both spatial and temporal derivatives, ensuring the equations remain solvable across time steps.

### 5. **Pressurized Pipe Flow**

For pipes always under pressure, InfoWorks ICM uses a different set of equations that do not involve the Preissmann slot method.

#### A. **Continuity in Pressurized Pipes**
\[
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = 0
\]

This equation reflects the fact that the flow rate remains constant in pressurized pipes.

#### B. **Momentum in Pressurized Pipes**
\[
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} + gA \left( \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} - S_0 + \frac{Q |Q|}{K^2} \right) = 0
\]

This equation accounts for the balance of forces in a fully pressurized pipe, without the need for adjusting free-surface conditions.

### 6. **Boundary Conditions and Continuity Equation**

Boundary conditions ensure that the system's solutions remain consistent at the ends of the conduits:

\[
f(Q_i, Y_i, Y_j) = 0
\]

#### A. **Continuity at Nodes**
\[
Q_i + \sum \beta_j Q_j = A_t \frac{dY_i}{dt}
\]
Where:
- \( Q_i \): Flow rate at node \( i \)
- \( Y_i \): Hydraulic head at node \( i \)
- \( \beta_j \): Weighting coefficient for flow contributions
- \( A_t \): Cross-sectional area at node \( i \)

This equation ensures that mass conservation is maintained at each node in the system.

### 7. **Model Precision and Stability**

The system in InfoWorks ICM is highly precise, solving the full Saint-Venant equations iteratively. Unlike other models, it is not restricted by the **Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition**, which ensures stability regardless of the time step or spatial discretization.

### 8. **Solution Flow**

- **Initialization**: Input the physical parameters (bed slope, cross-sectional area, flow rate) and initial conditions.
- **Discretization**: The domain is divided into spatial and temporal grids.
- **Time Stepping**: For each time step, solve the continuity and momentum equations iteratively using the Preissmann scheme.
- **Update**: Calculate the new values for flow rate and water depth at each spatial point for each time step.
- **Final Output**: Output the flow rate, water depth, and cross-sectional area for all time steps and spatial locations.
